title: 3 lessons learned from my first developmental edit
---
1) Fear is normal, accept it, and you’ll be much better off from the start.  
Gods, I was terrified. I’d have a couple of beta-readers and the comments had been positive but having a professional eye look over and critically analyse your child–because yes, this is how I see it–it had my heart looping in my chest. But it was a good fear, it meant that finally what I had been working towards was becoming a reality. 

2) It will change. AGAIN.  
In my previous post, I mentioned the drastic changes that happened between my first draft and first personal revision. Well, guess what, it has only increased. I had to rethink chapters, rethink decisions within the story, had to explain and realise that some were simply useless to the story. I tweaked and added characters that weren’t even a part of the book originally, twisted povs and gave importance to side characters that weren’t going to be much in the first instance. I was terrified that by revealing too much, I would spoil the mystery when in fact it only added to it.    

3) It is worth it.  
I have learned so much about my universe, my magic system, my characters and my story. Having to explain your creation to an outsider is a demanding process, but I never would have expected it to be so rewarding. It made me think about what, and why, and how, and I came out of it with an enhanced richness I had not thought possible. I got out of my comfort zone–simply for having to write a male pov, which I was highly uncomfortable with at the beginning–, had to rampage my brain for explanations that I originally wanted to leave out.
