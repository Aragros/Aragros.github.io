Always thought about writing a book but never knew how to start? Oh well, don’t we all go through that stage? I am sure you’ve heard it before, but you just need to start. The first step, the first brick, the first word, the first paragraph.

I spent many hours researching the best technique, the most efficient trick, but truth is–everyone has their own process and you need to find what works for you, so knowing yourself is key. 

You like lists, and details and every movement planned before putting the prose in? Great, do that, plot ahead. Or maybe you just like improvising and going with the flow? Then write, and figure the stuff out as you go. 

I had the core idea of the story figured out but, honestly, it has changed so much since the first draft that I don’t even know where the main plot for some characters has disappeared to–well hidden, though. I didn’t have a plan–still don’t–and I wrote bits and pieces and scenes and chapters as they came to me in absolutely no order. 

And that’s ok. That’s completely fine, which I had to remind myself of constantly because I was so scared it would harden the task of putting it all together. Of course, there were details I had to adjust because I forgot, but who wouldn’t? Unless you write the book in a month and don’t have time to forget any of it, you will have to comb through anyway. 

I spent about two years on the first draft–I wasn’t in a hurry and had a very demanding day job (also, I liked having a life for my brain to cool down)–which seems awfully long to me when I think about it. It was merely a distant dream I was eyeing from a distant window, a thought lying low in my mind. And then, somehow, I had a pile of paper in my hands.
I jumped up and up and around when I typed that gods-damned last word. I couldn’t actually believe that I had finally finished that thing I had been birthing for two years. 

Then I printed it out.  
Then I read it all together for the first time.  
Ah, well.  
They don’t psychologically prepare you at the non-writer school for the skeleton of the skeleton of the skeleton of your final piece. 
After my first read, somehow, a third of my book had become a third of the second instalment. After the first read of that new thing, there was a new character. After the first read of that, there were new POVs.
Hum, excuse-me, CHARACTERS, what happened to the original plot? I realised I had not much say in what was going on anymore and let them just lead their own lives. You know, let the kids play outside and make their own decisions.  
I wasn’t expecting the story–and myself, as I grew–to evolve that much, and that was solely through my own input. I understood from that moment that it would keep growing and evolving as I searched for professionals to help me polish all the jagged corners.

The <u>biggest</u> boost - if you feel stuck, print out what you have, it was a HUGE motivator when I needed a sheer.
