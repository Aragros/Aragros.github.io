“The Boneless Prince left trails of terror and pain in his wake. But his energy awoke my fire in a way it never reacted before.”

When her home is destroyed and her father killed, eighteen years old Freya promises to avenge him. She lets herself get captured and enslaved into the royal household to find the man who slew him. But when she meets the youngest prince, she is faced with a reflection that shatters her very core. Will she stay away or use him to fulfil her goal?  

Alexander Kazarian is the youngest prince of Machize, known throughout the continent as the cruel Boneless Prince. He will bow to nothing before he is crowned heir to his father’s kingdom.
