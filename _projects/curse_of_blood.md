*Engulfed in darkness, she will stumble upon her own.*
On Fanhalen, world-walking was once a coveted gift wielded only by the Castellain line. But their line is long gone, and since the sudden disappearance of magic at the beginning of the Shadow War, it is only a whispered memory.

In Mahena’s world, twenty-first century Earth, magic doesn’t exist. But when she awakens in another realm, it rapidly becomes clear that whatever magical fragments remain, they react to her. Plagued by dreams and visions of a past she doesn’t remember, and a cruel voice at the back of her head that isn’t hers, she has no choice but to place her trust in the two secretive, mysterious twins who took her in. 

With a death warrant on her head, Emmerentia has been in hiding, with the help of her twin, Fàaran, since the war began. When she learns that a part of her memory might have been stolen from her, she decides to come out of the shadows in search of answers. With a complicated past and twisted emotions, the twins’ unwavering loyalty will be put to the test in the face of this new threat. 

To find the answer to the mist surrounding Mahena’s true identity, they all must travel to the Scholar-Kingdom, where the last spell cast still holds, and the world’s most coveted collection of  knowledge resides. But through a land ravaged by spreading Shadows, will they find their way through the dark?
