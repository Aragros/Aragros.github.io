                Do you love fantasy but struggle to find inclusive stories?
                Do you wish for more representation and an epic world? Perhaps you even like sarcasm, and discovering new cultures. 
                Well, in that case, we might get along...  
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a Liège-based fantasy author (tiny Belgium if you feel like looking it up), 
                who spent the majority of her adult life in London and gallivanting around the world. 
                My love for travelling has only been beaten by my passion for writing and all things fantasy, and is a great source of inspiration. 
                I have been spinning tales since childhood and am currently working on her first series, 
                <a href="/projects/" title="See my ongoing projects">’A Curse of Blood and Power’</a>.
            </p> 
            <p> 
                <em>I have a profound love for diversity and multiculturality.</em> 
                I come from two very different backgrounds–my dad is Belgian and my mum is North-Ossetian, 
                and you could hardly find more opposite in terms of education, culture, traditions. 
                Hence why I feel drawn to creating and developing new worlds, with as many differences as I can think of. 
                I feel very lucky to have been brought up with both as it has given me the open-mindedness to understand 
                and adapt to various ways of thinking and behaving. 
                And I want that, among other things, to transpire in my stories. 
                The idea behind ‘The Fanhalen Chronicles’ is to create a rich, complex universe, 
                with a variety of storylines and characters from all backgrounds of life. 
                I want to offer the chance to as many readers as possible to identify with one of my characters.

            <p>
                In my spare time,  when that happens, you can find me reading or watching anything with a sci-fi/fantasy twist, 
                playing sports (mostly punching and kicking things) and collecting daggers – yes, I love them more than I do most humans.
